## Hi, Iâ€™m Alejandra!
* I have been working with Next.js/React for the last couple of years.
* At the moment, I'm getting comfortable with TypeScript.
* I enjoy building or customizing Shopify e-commerce websites, whether it's with Liquid or Hydrogen.
* My favorite part of the frontend is enhancing the user experience with the power of CSS and crafting animations with Framer Motion or GSAP.
* Exploring current web trends and staying up to date with the latest developments is something I enjoy.

I'm currently on the lookout for a frontend role. I'd especially love to work at a creative company with a tight-knit team where I can expand and solidify my skills through a variety of projects. If you're hiring, let's chat! ðŸ‘‹

## Hi, Iâ€™m Alejandra! ðŸ‘‹
* I have been working with Next.js/React in the frontend for the last couple of years.
* At the moment, I'm completing Salt C# fullstack bootcamp. 
* I love having the tools to work both in the frontend and the backend. Particularly enjoying the visual aspects of frontend work, taking pride in crafting pixel-perfect designs and staying current with the latest trends.
